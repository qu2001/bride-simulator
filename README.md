# Simple Bridge Simulation Game

This is a simple bridge simulation game developed using the LÖVE 2D game library. The project was inspired by a mechanical engineering class, where we had to develop a basic truss simulator using the finite element method (FEM).

## Features
- Uses 1D beam elements to calculate stress and strain in structures.
- Basic rendering for visualizing bridge structures.
- Future plans include an editor for building bridges and varying load scenarios (e.g., vehicles).

## Inspiration
The idea for this project came from a course where we programmed a simple truss simulation using FEM. This game aims to expand on that concept by adding interactive elements and game mechanics.

## Requirements
- [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

## How to Run
1. Download and install the [LÖVE 2D engine](https://love2d.org/) version 11.3.
2. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bridge-simulation.git`
3. Run the game with LÖVE:  
   `love .`
